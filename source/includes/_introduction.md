# Introduction

**Congrats** you are about to work with the most mobility friendly system:

    - Why do dragons sleep during the day?

    - So they can fight knights

**;-)**

**Welcome** to the **Joinup API**!

You can use our API to request Joinups (taxis, VTCs and motorcycles) using our API endpoints.

We have language bindings in Shell, but you can use any programming language (Python, Java, Ruby, Javascript, etc). You can view code examples in the dark area to the right.
