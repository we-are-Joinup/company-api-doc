**Welcome** to the **API Documentation for Joinup Providers**!

Our API allows you to request Joinups (taxis, VTCs and motorcycles) using our API endpoints.

We have language bindings in Shell, Python & Java, but it is up to you to use any programming language (Python, Java, Ruby, Javascript, etc). You will find code examples in the right dark area.
