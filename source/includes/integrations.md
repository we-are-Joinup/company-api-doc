# Integrations

You can integrated with us of several ways. In this documentation, we will focus on Server to server integration, but you must know that we have another ways to connect with us. In client to server integration the endpoints are the same, almost everything is the same, but for example the AAI (Authentication and authorization infrastructure) is different or we don't need an own push system.

## Server to server

You can choose between two ways:

    - Connecting with us using a generic user. 
    - Every request uses the end-user to authorize (see more info in <i>Authentication, Authorization & Impersonate<i> section)

## Client to server

You can choose between two ways:
    - Own development.
    - We can do a clone web and app for you. We can do it very quicly
