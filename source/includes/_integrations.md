# 2. Integration types

You can integrate with us in several ways. In this documentation, we will focus on Server to server integration, but you must know that we have other ways to connect with us. In client to server integration the endpoints are the same, almost everything is the same, but for example the <a href="#5-authentication-authorization-amp-impersonate">AAI</a> (Authentication and authorization infrastructure) is different or we don't need an own push system.

## 2.1 Server to server

You can choose between two ways:

    - Connecting with us using a generic user. 

    - Every request uses the end-user to authorize (see more info in <a href="#5-authentication-authorization-amp-impersonate">AAI</a> section)

## 2.2 Client to server

You can choose between two ways:

    - Own development. You can create a Web or App and connect with this API
    
    - We can do a clone of our web or/and our app for you with several customizations. We can do it very quickly :-)
