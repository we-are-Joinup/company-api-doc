<p>You can integrated with us of several ways. In this documentation, we will focus on Server to server integration, but you must know that we have another ways to connect with us. In client to server integration the endpoints are the same, almost everything is the same, but for example the AAI (Authentication and authorization infrastructure) is different or we don&#39;t need an own push system.</p>

<p>- Connecting with us using a generic user.
